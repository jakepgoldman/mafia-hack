  transcript: |
    [Jonathan]: I'm not the mafia. I'm just a gardener. I've done some bad things in the past, but I'm not the mafia.
    [Marge]: I did it. I'm the mafia.
    [Alex]: That's a bold claim, Marge. Why would you admit to that?
    [Marge]: Because it's the truth.
    [Sam]: Or maybe you're just trying to throw us off, Marge. I don't know who to believe.
    [Jonathan]: I've known Marge for a while, but this is really suspicious.
    [Marge]: Believe what you want, but I can't change your minds.
    [Alex]: Jonathan, do you really think Marge would just come out and say that if she were the mafia?
    [Jonathan]: I don't know, but it sounds too convenient. She's hiding something, I can feel it.
